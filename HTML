What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure content based on its meaning, 
not just its apperance, making web pages more understandable for both humans and
machines. 

Semantic HTML focuses on conveying the meaning of the content, rather than just how it looks. 
Semantic elements have names that describe their purpose, like <article>, <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
